# Calculator in Assembly

This is a basic calculator that is written using assembly programming and is run on Easy68k. This project is part of my introduction to microprocessor course in my university.

## Features

- Do logical (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and arithmetics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) operations.
- Handles signed numbers
- Gives quotient and remainder for division operation
- Logical operations automatically convert user input to binary or hexadecimal

## Progress

:white_check_mark: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND
:x: OR, NOT, XOR, trim binary output
