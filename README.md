# Calculator in Assembly

This is a basic calculator that is written using assembly programming and is run on Easy68k. This project is part of my introduction to microprocessor course in my university.

## Features

- Do logical (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and arithmetics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) operations.
- Handles signed numbers
- Gives quotient and remainder for division operation
- Logical operations only accept binary numbers. If non-binary numbers are given, program will restart.

## Progress

:white_check_mark: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, trim binary output

## Bugs

- NOT operation doesn't trim the exess '1's
